Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following important conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.
Additional Provisions (Menhera-Inspired Guidelines):

While the above constitutes the core of the license, governing the legal use and distribution of the Software, the following provisions are added to reflect the spirit of "Menhera" and encourage a supportive and healthy community:

    Kindness and Consideration: We expect all users to interact with each other with kindness and consideration, especially towards those who may be experiencing emotional difficulties or vulnerabilities. Harassment, derogatory language, and discrimination are strictly prohibited.
    Mutual Support: Users are encouraged to offer support and understanding to one another within the community related to the Software. However, it's important to maintain healthy boundaries and avoid excessive dependency.
    Self-Care: Prioritizing your own mental well-being is essential. If you're feeling overwhelmed or struggling, please take a break and seek support if needed.
    Responsibility: These Menhera-inspired provisions are not intended to excuse harmful behavior or allow anyone to evade responsibility for their actions. The use of this Software should always be accompanied by a commitment to ethical conduct and respect for others.
    Conflict Resolution: In the event of disagreements or conflicts, users are strongly encouraged to communicate directly and respectfully with each other. If direct resolution is not possible, seeking the assistance of a neutral community member to facilitate discussion is recommended.

Important Note:

The Menhera-inspired provisions are intended as guidelines for fostering a positive and supportive community. While they are not legally binding in the same way as the core MIT License terms, adherence to these principles is crucial for maintaining a healthy environment for everyone involved. We believe that a little extra care and understanding can go a long way.
